# Dumbphone

This is a command-line tool for making my Alcatel A392CC flip phone just a little bit smarter. It builds on a few other projects in various states of completion:

 - https://github.com/andyinabox/dumbp-a392cc-cli
 - https://github.com/andyinabox/dumbp-gmap-directions
 - https://github.com/andyinabox/dumbp-read

**Note:** For me this is a Go learner project so use at your own risk.
