# CRISPR Workshop (9-6-2016)

## Naturally occurring system

* Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
  * XXXXXATTAXXXXXATTAXXXXXATTA
* Describes these repeating sequences, but has come to refer to the whole technology
* Sequences and Cas (CRISPR-associated) proteins are the two elements of an ancient defense system conserved in bacterial and archael genomes.

Found in 40% of known bacteria genomes and 90% of archaea

3 types of systems

Type II is the simplest, only one enzyme required for targeting/cleavage

 * Cas 9

They require production of RNA sequences...

CRISPR is a memory system

A defence against virus

Cas proteins are the actual effectors

Cas is a guided missile, RNA is guidance system

Three stages

 1. Acquire and incorporate spaces from encountered mobile elements (phage/plasmids)
 2. Transcribe and process crRNAs
 3. Target and destroy invaders
 
 War between two institutions: Berkely vs. Gen Institute
  * Different histories from different insitutions
  
Ishino was the first to discover 29 base pair spacers

Francisco Mojica discrovered mysterious short repeats in archaea
 * Discovers 20 different microbes that contained the pattern
 * Mojica was first to propose that it was an immune system function
 * Supposedly came up with CRISPR
 
Yogurt people were interested  

2012, Doudna and Charpentier
 * Showed the targeting system with RNA as "guide"

Took off incredibly fast. Went to editing a human embryo on 3.4 years
* Scientists called for a moritorium

CRISPR is way easier, more affordable, and capable of complex operations

* Cas9 creates double-break of DNA strand
* As repair system starts, it's hijacked
* All that's needed is a 20-character RNA
* Two repair pathways: NHEJ/HDR
 * NHEJ -- just jam the two ends together (Gene Disruption)
 * HDR - Looks for a homologous region and uses that to repair (Gene Edition)

 * Mid-1970's-present: restriction endonucleases
  * Swapping DNA from one gene to another
  * Innate immune system
  * CRISPR does a similar action, but acquired
  * Have to do it in a test tube    
* Late 80's to present: site-specific recombinase
 * Enzyme does both cutting and recombination
 * Can be done in an organism
 * Limited to one location (or two or three)
 * Goal is to have something that you can program to cut anywayse
* mid 90's - present : programmable endonucleases
 * Zinc Finger Nocleases (mid 90s)
  * Protein motif that holds zinc ion 
 * TALENs (2010)
 * These require protein engineering
* CRISPR (2013)
 * Programmable part is RNA, not protein
 * sgRNA -> guide RNA
 * Really easy to engineer
 * Cas9 Protein (hard part) doesn't change
 * Doing what's been done before, but _way easier_
 
 ## Process
 
 * "scaffold" connects to Cas9
 * "spacer" is the custom part
  * 20 nucleotides long
  * "seed region" important for binding
 * Needs a site complimentary to the spacer region
 * PAM site -- critical sequence required for Cas9 to do initial binding (NGG)
 * Cas9 bounces around, stops at PAM sites and checks for matching sequences
  * Cut is 3 nucleotides in
 * Software algorithms help design guide RNA
 * Really, just breaks the DNA
 * Two pathways to fixing (see NHEJ  & HDR above)
  * NHEJ is error prone, good for breaking things but not much else
  * HDR is good for fixing/adding genes
   * Need a repair template
    * need "homology arm" on either side of desired change within template   
 * CRISPR can do multiple simultanious edits
 * One challenge is not having it go to the wrong site
 * Can also have a "dCas9" that acts as shuttle to a particular location on the strand
 
 ## Setting up your operation
 
  1. Develop a biological question
  2. Select your desired manipulation
  3. 
  ....
  Cloning (all sucks, but in different ways)
  
  
  1. Choose a species
  2. Select gene region to be targeted
  3. Select gRNAs based on predicted "on-target" and "off-target" activity
  4. Sythesize and clone desired gRNAs
  5. Deliver gRNA and Cas9 and validate genome edit!

  * Converts guide arm sequence into longer sequences that are clonable (oligos)

CRISPR "doesn't leave a trace"


Allows you to edit before the "germ line" which means that it will be expressed in offspring

Possibly will be used in the eye
 
 CRISPR Patent war!
 
  * Maraffini filed in 2008, but didn't have enough expirimental demonstration
  * Doudna applied in 2014
  * Broad Institute filed expedited application and got it first
  * Doudna filed a dispuse of USPO
  
  Gene Drives - ??
  "A Prudent Path Forward for Genomic Engineering..." â€” convened in Baltimore, similar to meeting in 1970 with many of the same people present

October 2015 - Church simultaniously edits 62 sites in pig genome
Nov - Harvard unveiled CRISPR mosquito for malaria
Dec - At the end of ear US, UK, and Chna meet about engineering human embryos

Beijing Genomics Institute

CRISPR editing im Humans

 * Now it's totally possible to edit genes in humans
 * Complete ban is impractical given the availabilty of CRISPR
 * Don't edit the human germ line
 * In U.S. regulation tends to be based exclusively on funding
 * Peter Nygard essentially bought the Bahamas to do this research
 * Crick Institute (UK) granted perm to engineer to do CRISPR on embryos
 * You can make a genetic mod that gets outside all genetic oversight
   * If you just knock out a gene, it's indistinguishable from a naturally-ocurring break and there's no foreign DNA  
* Oxitec Mosquito: male mosquito with lethal gene
  * This would crash the mosquito population 
  * Needs to be repopulated
  * Trying to get permission to release in Florida
* "Gene Drives" it's possible to completely eradicate a species
  * You actually carry the crispr gene within the genome
  * The DNA you put in is the CRISPR system itself
  * It continues to self-propogate  
 
 
 * Human cloning scandal with cult (Raeliens)
